## Summary
This interactive front-end application generates a randomized activity that corresponds to the weather for that day. For example, if the weather is nice, the activity will be outside for that day. Once a user loads the application they are presented with the current day and an activity for that specific day. The end user has the ability to scroll to a previous or future day and load the specific data for that day. The application utilizes Bored.api to generate a random activity with relevant data, it uses Day.js for time tracking and uses Tomorrow.io to fetch daily weather. The application uses local storage so that end users have the ability to click into logged activities and view the completed activities and dates that they were completed.
